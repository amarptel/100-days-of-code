# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: March 24th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've begun my 100 days of code challenge and the initial challenge I am taking on is creating a website for my portfolio. I've dabbled in back-end work, but really have no front-end experience, so I am starting from scratch. Today I mapped out my website and started adding in a navbar. 

**Thoughts:**: Adding in the contents of the navbar was fairly easy and I was able to do so without much effort. Styling the navbar, on the otherhand was a pain and it took me a while to position the text on the right without it looking awkward. I went through tutorials with a bunch of parameters, but just used the ones I understand at this point in time (font-weight, float). Hopefully styling gets easier, or I am alteast able to understand it better.

Day 2: March 25th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Successfully added in a navbar with a logo. 

**Thoughts:**: I've tried to create a website before to no avail, and one of the biggest sticking points for me was not being able to add in a navbar with a logo. It took some time today, but after reading a bit of documentation and watching a couple videos, I'm starting to understand css better and was able to successfully add in a navbar for my wbsite with a logo. I never understood why the logo didn't fit within the contents of the navbar, but this time I finally figured out it was due to the size of my image and not my code. I found a smaller image and was able to position it nicely along my navbar. Next step is to add a nice hover transition to the navbar links.

Day 3: March 26th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to add a transition to nav items.

**Thoughts:**: I've learnt about the hover before and after parameters of css and have successfully made my original text navigate upwards (translateY). However, I am dealing with an issue where the new text isn't rotating upwards and taking the place of my old text. This is something I will try to learn about tomorrow and fix.

Day 4: March 27th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Successfully added in a transition to navbar items. 

**Thoughts:**: Used a tutorial to add in a transition for my navbar items. I understand it better than I did yesterday, but still not as much as I'd like. I looked up documentation on position and display, which I sort of understand, but am still finding it hard to picture. Completely understand translate and hover now. I want to add in a button in my navbar where my resume can be downloaded, without any tutorial, just good old googling and my own intuition. That is tomorrow's goal.

Day 5: March 28th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Successfully added a link in navbar which opens my resume. 

**Thoughts:**: Intially thought I'd have to create a button and add an onclick function via javascript that would donwload my resume, but found that there is an href and download utility in HTML5, which assisted my in adding the link to the navbar. Tried to work on various ways of styling and figured out how to individually style individual elements in the li tag. Will design my the resume button nicely in my navbar. Also found out my logo overflows the navbar, so I will want to adjust that.

Day 6: March 29th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added in styling and css to resume link, changed font of navbar and learned about the HTML5 sections in preperation for creating the main content of my webpage. 

**Thoughts:**: Lots of manual adjusting here with the styling, but I am getting through it. Wonder if it would've been easier if I used something like bootstrap, but alas I am here and will continue with what I've started. Added in some basic content for my webpage and researched the HTML5 layout. Will want to finish the home section styling in the near future!

Day 7: March 30th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Changed styling to a background colour that I like and chose a font for the home section of my webpage. 

**Thoughts:**: Continuing to learn about styling and trying to figure out how I want my homepage to look and learning how to adjust the css to that. My goal for tomorrow is to position the text correctly and add in logos of github and linked-in that redirect the user to those links. Also want them to light up on hover.

Day 8: March 31st, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Repositioned text on homepage to where I wanted it and added in icons to my socials. 

**Thoughts:**: Found a cool website that allows me to use their logos, so I was able to get them onto the homescreen of my webpage and adjust them to the size I like. I was able to change the github icon to change colour on hover and the linked-in icon to an extent, but not the twitter icon yet. This is my next challenge along with redirecting the user on-click of my icons to their respective webpages. Learned a lot about padding also.

Day 9: April 1st, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Successfully changed the icons to change colour on hover and added links in, so when the icons are clicked, they redirect one to my portion of the specific webpage. 

**Thoughts:**: Honestly, fixing the logo hover issue I had yesterday was very easy, just took a neutral logo and added the correct colour to it, then added in a hover function via css. Had an indication of how to redirect the user on click of the icons, and added that in too, which was a breeze. Spent most of today researching how I want my the homepage of my website to look and I've figured it out. Want to add in a bounce to my name (individual letters) and a rotating list of things I am/like which transition in and out slowly. That is the goal for the next few days.

Day 10: April 2nd, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Researched a bunch of different methods to reveal one letter of text at a time for my name and I believe I found a javascript and css way to do so. 

**Thoughts:**: Spent most of my time trying to make the javascript method work, but was unable to do so today. I think I could get the css method to work fairly easily, but since I'd like to learn javascript as well, I want to try and do it using that method. Will continue to work on this tomorrow. Also, I found that the revolving/rotating text that I want, is called morphing text. Will hope to add that in soon as well.

Day 11: April 3rd, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added a JavaScript function that allows the letters of my name to appear one by one, when the homepage is first opened. I believe I understand how it is working to a degree. Also was able to add in the rotating text!

**Thoughts:**: Seriously made some good progress today and added in exactly what I wanted for my homepage. I think I am getting better at researching what I want and implementing it - or I just got really lucky today. CSS is really becoming understood by me, which is great! Want to dive into JS and understand it just as much. Tomorrow's goal is solely styling my homepage, so I can move on to the "about" section in the near future. Also, need to fix the transition from the first section of text to the second as it is a quicker transition then the rest. Additionally, want to add in a fading in/out feature when the text is spinning.

Day 12: April 4th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Removed spinning text, thought it was too much right now, may add it back later. Worked on homepage styling and found a found that I like and will use for my website. 

**Thoughts:**: Styling is legitimately the most meticulous part of this website building and as I'm going along, I'm figuring out how I want the website to look. It's fun but can be tedious. Want to add in a description tomorrow about myself and continue to work on styling.

Day 13: April 5th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on homepage styling and was able to finally to reduce the margin between the text. Also, I'm working on making the navbar translucent upon scrolling down.

**Thoughts:**: Almost done styling the homepage, might want to add a bit more text and potentially an image but aside from that I think it's pretty good. Tried to figfure out a way to make the navbar transparent, so the text can be slightly seen as the user scrolls down.

Day 14: April 10th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned more vanilla JS today and made a bit of progress trying to make my navbar translucent when scrolling. 

**Thoughts:**: Took a 5 day haitus, but now am back and will be consistent daily. Today was mostly spent on research and learning a bit of JS.

Day 15: April 11th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Was able to make the navbar translucent upon scrolling, directly using css in javascript!! Learned that I can directly implement css in JS and had a refresher around padding and margins. 


**Thoughts:**: Turns out I didn't need it though, as I could just set the background colour and opacity of the navbar with rgba. This allows the text in the navbar to stay bold and it doesn't lose opacity when scrolling, while the navbar is always at 0.5 opacity. Made some good progress though! Want to add in a logo and add a bit more text on the homepage, then move on to the about section.

Day 16: April 11th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added in a nice logo border and text. Just need to center and style text in border and my logo will be complete, so my homepage will be done.


**Thoughts:**: Did quite a bit of research and learned how to create a nice logo border, but for some reason was not able to center the text at all. Will do this tomorrow.
