# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: March 24th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've begun my 100 days of code challenge and the initial challenge I am taking on is creating a website for my portfolio. I've dabbled in back-end work, but really have no front-end experience, so I am starting from scratch. Today I mapped out my website and started adding in a navbar. 

**Thoughts:**: Adding in the contents of the navbar was fairly easy and I was able to do so without much effort. Styling the navbar, on the otherhand was a pain and it took me a while to position the text on the right without it looking awkward. I went through tutorials with a bunch of parameters, but just used the ones I understand at this point in time (font-weight, float). Hopefully styling gets easier, or I am alteast able to understand it better.
