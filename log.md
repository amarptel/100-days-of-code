# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: March 24th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've begun my 100 days of code challenge and the initial challenge I am taking on is creating a website for my portfolio. I've dabbled in back-end work, but really have no front-end experience, so I am starting from scratch. Today I mapped out my website and started adding in a navbar. 

**Thoughts:**: Adding in the contents of the navbar was fairly easy and I was able to do so without much effort. Styling the navbar, on the otherhand was a pain and it took me a while to position the text on the right without it looking awkward. I went through tutorials with a bunch of parameters, but just used the ones I understand at this point in time (font-weight, float). Hopefully styling gets easier, or I am alteast able to understand it better.

Day 2: March 25th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Successfully added in a navbar with a logo. 

**Thoughts:**: I've tried to create a website before to no avail, and one of the biggest sticking points for me was not being able to add in a navbar with a logo. It took some time today, but after reading a bit of documentation and watching a couple videos, I'm starting to understand css better and was able to successfully add in a navbar for my wbsite with a logo. I never understood why the logo didn't fit within the contents of the navbar, but this time I finally figured out it was due to the size of my image and not my code. I found a smaller image and was able to position it nicely along my navbar. Next step is to add a nice hover transition to the navbar links.
